This repo displays the final project of this Database Applications and Information Systems course consisting of a brief Python build intended to implement a 3NF relational database schema developed over the course of the semester. The application simply must connect to a RDBMS, pose necessary SQL queries, and display the results to an end-user. The program is a poker night management system for social home poker games. Primarily, it tracks users' buy-ins and cash-outs before calculating and distributing the simplest transactions for players to settle their debts at the end of a game.

This now serves as the first iteration of an ongoing personal project. Beyond things like overhauling the UI and developing a more robust algorithm, I am working to add features like automatic chip counting via image recognition and integrated payment processing with Venmo.
