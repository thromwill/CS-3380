Setup:

Before running the application, you will need to install the following dependencies using pip:

	Flask
	mysql-connector-python

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

	pip install Flask mysql-connector-python

This application requires a MySQL database to store data. You can set up the database by following these steps:

	Make sure the MySQL server is running on your machine.
	Create a new database using the poker.sql schema file provided in this repository.

	In app.py, configure your MySQL connection by updating the following lines with your MySQL server i	information:

	# Configure MySQL connection
	db = mysql.connector.connect(
    		host="127.0.0.1",          # MySQL server hostname
    		user="root",               # MySQL username
    		password="password",       # MySQL password
    		database="poker"   	   # MySQL database name
	)
	Replace the values for host, user, password, and database with your own MySQL server information.

To run the application, simply execute the app.py file by running the following command:

	python app.py

The Flask application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser.
